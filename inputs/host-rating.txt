"Evergreen Hotel in winter? A mistake. The heating barely worked, the roads were icy, and the staff seemed overwhelmed. Spent the whole trip freezing!"

"What a lovely experience! The gardens were in full bloom, the weather was perfect, and the staff was incredibly welcoming. Evergreen Hotel in spring is magical!"

"Summer at Evergreen Hotel was just okay. The pool was overcrowded, and the AC struggled with the heat. The lake was nice, but the mosquitoes were unbearable."

"Beautiful autumn scenery! The colorful leaves and cozy fireplaces made for a great stay. The only downside? The restaurant was often full, so reservations were a must."
